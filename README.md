## Points to keep in mind while contributing:
- Issues will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit and complete the issue within 7 days.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution. You can use the templates that we have provided :)
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- Add a screenshot of the output in the PR's description after the changes you have made
